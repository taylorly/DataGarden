        <h2>A Writer's Room</h2>
        <p>This data visualization is documentation of the beginning of my writing journey. Over the course of fourteen days, I recorded my writing habits in my journal. The goal was to measure how much I write and where I wrote more words while writing in the confines of my room.</p>
        <p>The flower represents another way to visualize the amount of words I wrote. Since this fourteen day experience, I have began to write my novel. I am handwriting my first draft and I have what I presume is thousands of words. At first glance, the trend line may not seem like much. However, I know how much I have grown since then. I understand now how important it is to climb over the hill of intimidation and ignore the allure of perfection that prevents some of the truest writing coming into fruition.</p>
        <p>Every Word Counts.</p>
